description: Good leaders get stuff done. It is part of the job description,
  after all. Great leaders inspire, and in order to inspire you must reach for
  that part of yourself that is truly authentic and unique.

Recently I came into a situation where I had to ask myself, what would be a good advice for someone who's just become a new leader? If I look back at my own path, there were plenty of resources I grabbed to help guide me in this path, since as a founder you usually don't have someone above you to look up to. Sure, there's mentors, public figures inside and outside the tech industry and people you find inspirational but I always felt I was on my own to figuring out how to lead a growing team. **In this post I'd like to share some advice that, while it might seem rather abstract, might help you look at your own path and inspire you to explore differently your leadership TODO**

Before diving deeper I would like to get a definition out of the way. The leader's job is to empower it's team members to do their best work, create a healthy and safe environment where people live healthy lives inside and outside work while making sure the team stays aligned with the general vision of the company. It's a people job and communication is key. That said, on this post I want to focus on how aspiring leaders can work on themselves to become better at it, so if some of this advice seems rather individualistic keep in mind that the ultimate goal is the one stated above. 

Of course there's a lot of practical advice which is useful as an starting point eg. empower your team, be a facilitator not a problem solver, make sure communication flows both ways, listen (really listen) to people. But that's been said a thousand times. There's something else to being a great leader that goes beyond a list of bullet points you can follow, because it seems rather abstract and it's hard to put into words: great leaders  inspire.

I believe that in order to inspire you must find your own  style and then apply within the context of the team. Ultimately being as a leader you wan't to create the best possible environment for your team to thrive within the office and beyond it's walls. This comes out of knowing yourself, knowing your weaknesses and strengths so you can determine how to build around your strengths and cover your weaknesses. It's also an exercise of knowing yourself so you can cover your weaknesses and play to your strengths in a way that creates the best environment for your team. 

Going one step further there's inspiration. Great leaders not only motivate people to get things done they somehow inspire everyone around them to become part of a greater goal. I'd say it's impossible to be inspirational while following someone else's ways it must come from within.

In order to communicate leaders usually tell stories. There's a lot to story telling that goes beyond the scope of this article but when it comes to anecdotical

I think the reason it's hard to describe what being
