## Intro

Recently [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) has been gaining more popularity every day. It's a great framework and I'm happy to see it succeed given how much value I've gotten out of it personally and how much I've learned from the people behind it. It's success has also made it easier to get buy in from team members to include it on a project, as opposed to a few years back when it was still rather new and atomic css wasn't a widely used approach. While it's not intended to solve every possible problem in the styling space it's flexible enough that I've used it on almost every project I've started since 2016. However, some of my reasons go beyond CSS maintainabilityI'd like to explore them in this article.

## How it all started

On 2016 I started developing a new consumer product along with my partners at [Savy](https://savy.co). At the time it was pretty common to bring in Bootstrap to get going with styling primitives such as typography, colors and a few components. I chose not to include a template since I'd experience the pain of trying to break out of themes in the past. It was a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) project, so I installed `bootstrap-sass`, changed the default theme's colors and got down to business. Naturally I quickly bumped into use cases where I wanted to change things up a bit. For example, adding some extra spacing to a Card component. To my delight, bootstrap included helper utilities where you could just _augment_ the HTML with clases like `mb-5` to add a bit of spacing between components. Throw in the padding, positioning, display, and color utilities I quickly realized that _most_ of what I needed to do was achievable without leaving my CSS. Turned out there was a framework that took this idea as it's basis and it was love at first sight.

## More than just utility classes

Tailwind did so much more than provide a styling solution for an application developer. It created an ecosystem, of tools, learning materials and design defaults that made it easy to succeed while learning.

### It taught me CSS

Seriously, I have to thank the Tailwind docs for finally making flexbox click in my brain. The pictures along with the code samples were so helpful in understanding the different properties at play in a flex container. The axis, flow, direction, wrap... it was all there. It's not like I learnt it overnight, I had to keep coming back to the docs basically every time I needed to create a layout. But the fact that I could look up the primitives of how to achieve something in flex instead of trying to copy paste some CSS classes of something that looked like what I wanted to build instead of creating my own was a turning point for me. This also applies to the display properties, positioning, margins and paddings and well.. so much more.

> As an aside note I remember when, after having used tailwind for a couple of months, I could suddenly _see_ a UI and decompose it into it's individual properties. Being able to think this card component is just a flex container with rounded corners, a shadow and some padding inside felt like being Neo watching the matrix for the first time.

### It gave me ownership of my CSS

This is the part where we talk about maintainability. While it can be off putting to have so many classes on your HTML (and if your design is _very_ detailed such as tailwindUI's there are even more) being able to come back to a component and _know_ that you can replace everything in it without breaking something else is worth it on it's own.

### It's a win for developer productivity

I place a lot or value around how the tailwind workflow enables you to quickly try out designs without having to jump between files. This is specially true for web design projects such as landing pages and marketing sites although it can get pretty repetitive on web apps that have more component reuse across the board. I also find it relatively straight forward to implement someone else's design, which is a big win for teams that have designers working in Figma.

### It taught me (web) design fundamentals

This is part of Tailwind's ecosystem rather than the library itself, but following Steve and Adam taught me a lot about design. Their focus in putting out tips of design for developers was right up my alley and I consumed every bit of information they put out on twitter, medium, etc. All these tips eventually turned into Refactoring UI which is a great read if you haven't given it a try.

### It introduced me to the idea of design as a system

Okay kind of. The framework has grown a lot since the 0.7 days when you could say that the limiting set of utilities was a way to enforce design constraints but now a days there's so many utilities that the whole _Tailwind is a design system_ idea might be debatable. Then there's also the introduction of the JIT compiler, which allows you you to create one off utilities on the fly. Still, I'd argue that tailwind defaults push you in the right direction and make it easy for everyone on the project to enforce some design constraints.

### It's easy to jump between projects

Since the utilities remain consistent between older versions and projects, unless you use more semantic names which is generally fine, it's easy to come back to a project and pick up where you left off. This is specially true when it comes to modifying existing components since you can be sure not to break styling anywhere else.

## The future

I'll probably keep using Tailwind on my personal projects. It keeps pushing it's own boundaries so it's also been an interesting journey to keep up with it and what's possible beyond the initial idea of utility classes. But this space is in constant flux, and new paradigms emerge everyday as the web evolves. CSS variables have already unlocked some new approaches such as [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style) which I'm excited to explore for component based frameworks and widespread use of Custom Elements might need a different approach. It is, after all, still an exciting time for being a web developer.
