      <p>
        My name is Felipe. I'm a software engineer, web developer and entrepreneur.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent my last couple of years building
        <a href="https://savy.co">Savy</a>, a Fitness and wellness marketplace that aimed to provide maximum flexibility to users and gyms by charging hourly based on a simple demand/offer model. Unfurtunately, due to COVID-19 we were forced to shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is were I plan to share some of the things I learnt about building a product, being a developer, managing a team and starting a company in Colombia.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site will serve both as a learning experience and as a playground to try out new things and share my thoughts along the way.
      </p>
